TPS65992DBG_Harman_Config_v01.pjt (tested with F809.11.A2)
-fixed template for Samsung charging issue
-included UART output from GPIO0
-set charge voltage to 8.3V
-set charge current to 3A 
-set pre-charge current to 240mA 
-set VINDPM to 91% of PDO voltage 
-set IINDPM to 100% of PDO current

TPS65992DBG_Harman_Config_v02.pjt (Work In Progress)
-set GPIO2 as enablesource_port1 (73)
-set PDO1 power path to PP3
-disable VCONN (needs to be implemented)

TPS65992DBG_Harman_Config_v03.pjt (tested with TPS65992_ENG_F809.11.A7.bin)
-minor tweaks, overall same as v02
-tested for PPHV for all PDOs
-tested with Samsung charger, no issues occured
-tested sourcing to S22, no issues occured

TPS65992DBG_Harman_Config_v04.pjt (tested with TPS65992_ENG_F809.11.A7.bin and A9)
-disable 'Automatic Cap Request' bit in Port Control (0x29) for PD tester issue

TPS65992DBG_Harman_Config_v05.pjt (tested with TPS65992_ENG_F809.11.A7.bin and A9)
-set number of valid sink PDOs from 5 (5/9/12/15/20) to 3 (5/9/12)

TESTING VERSION

TPS65992DBG_Harman_Config_vT3.pjt (tested with TPS65992_ENG_F809.11.A7.bin)
-based on v03
-decrease output voltage on VBUS/PPHV by 100mV (Source 5V is now 4.9V, etc.) by setting Code 0 Voltage to 2800000 uV (2800mV -> -100mV offset)
